Hi! My name is Will and I have a bit of coding experience but I wouldn't call myself a pro.
I am hoping I can use Git to help me stay active and on track with all my projects.
Most of my projects consist of small unity games and occasionally some web design. 
As a newcomer to this website I look forward to meeting the community and expanding my toolbelt.
